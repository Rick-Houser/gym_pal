#GymPal

The purpose of this app is to provide a single source for health-conscious people. GymPal is a Software as a Service (SaaS) app that allows users to create and keep track of their workouts in a supportive environment with other like-minded individuals. The app promotes safe workouts by providing the ability to search for specific exercises and how to correctly perform them without injury. In addition to exercises, users can search for and share their own healthy recipes with the GymPal community. As many know, exercise is just half the formula to a healthier life; the other half is a healthy and nutritious diet.
